### Installing and Setting up an Nginx Server

---

- Reference: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04

- Update system and install nginx (when complete, the server should be running):

```[bash]
     sudo apt update                            # update the system
     sudo apt upgrade -y                        # optionally upgrade the system
     sudo apt install nginx -y                  # install the server
     systemctl status nginx                     # check to see if the server is running
```

- should retun something similar to:

```[bash]
    > nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
    >     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; enabled)
    >     Active: active (running) since Sun 2020-07-05 11:56:35 UTC; 17min ago
    >       Docs: man:nginx(8)
    >   Main PID: 44687 (nginx)
    >      Tasks: 3 (limit: 4683)
    >     Memory: 4.5M
    >     CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
    >             ├─44687 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on
    >             ├─44688 nginx: worker process
    >             └─44689 nginx: worker process
```

- Get the IP address of the remote machine

```[bash]
     curl -4 icanhazip.com                          # returns an ip address
```

- On the local machine, check to make sure we can see the server (should return nginx welcome page)

```[bash]
    open http://192.241.144.39
```

- Some commands to control web server on remote machine (self explanitory)

```[bash]
     sudo systemctl stop nginx
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     sudo systemctl reload nginx
     sudo systemctl disable nginx
     sudo systemctl enable nginx                    # run the server as a service (will restart on reboot)
```

- The server is now serving over `http://`. To add `https://`, see [Enabling HTTPS](Enabling%20HTTPS.md)

- Test to see if the web server starts after reboot

```[bash]
     sudo reboot
```
