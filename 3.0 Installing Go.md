### Installing Go

---

- Download and install golang (Note: this build a test go program and runs it)

```[bash]
    cd ~/Development                                        # go to dev folder
    sudo apt install golang-go -y                           # install go
    git clone https://github.com/udhos/update-golang        # clone a script for updating/installing go
    cd update-golang                                        # move to that folder
    sudo ./update-golang.sh                                 # install the latest version of go
    go version                                              # show the version
```

- Edit shell profile (these instructions for fish shell) to add GOPATH

```[bash]
    which go                                                # note location of go executable
    pico ~/.config/fish/config.fish                         # edit config file
    set -x GOPATH $HOME/go                                  # add GOPATH
    set -x PATH $PATH /usr/local/go/bin                     # put go in PATH variable
    set -x PATH $PATH $GOPATH/bin                           # put go in PATH variable
```
